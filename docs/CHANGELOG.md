- Cleaner component structure with semantic HTML and reduced DOM nesting
- Enhanced keyboard navigation and form usability

## [0.2.3] - 2025-07-27 - 2025-07-31

### Added

- Loading states to `FormButton` so buttons won't be operable after clicking, and will provide a custom, reusable loading text in the button during the process
- Functionality to the scaffolded `Modal.jsx` file, including closing on Escape press.
- **forgot password** functionality by creating `ForgotPasswordModal.jsx`
- "Forgot Password" link added to `LoginPage`
- Vitest Testing suites for
  - `FormGroup.jsx`
  - `FormButton.jsx`
  - `ConfirmLogout.jsx`
  - `Loader.jsx`
  - `Modal.jsx`
  - `ForgotPasswordModal.jsx`
  - `StartQuestButton.jsx`
  - `MainContainer.test.jsx`
  - `PageLayout.jsx`
- Created `styles/modalStyles.js` file
  - Added reusable modal styles `modalOverlayStyle`, `modalContentStyle`, `modalHeadingStyle`, and `modalTextStyle` for ease of design work in the future

### Changed

- Updated `LoginPage` to add loading state functionality
- Updated `LoginPage` to include Modal functionality
- Updated Forgot Password email sent text for user satisfaction
- Imported and used `modalStyles.js` styles in `Modal`
- Imported and used `modalStyles.js` styles in `ForgotPasswordModal`

### Fixed

- Lots of debugging to get the `Modal` overlay styles to work correctly. Had lots of issues with text overlapping and modal text showing beneath the actual modal layer. Found the issues and fixed.
- Small bug fixes as I tested various suites. Nothing major.

### Issues

- Added an issue to the **Github Repository** and emailed Firebase support due to Forgot Password emails connecting to old API Browser key and not working correctly. Tried to debug and find settings in Firebase and Google Consoles, but at this point I need support to figure out how to update to new API key.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-08-01 - 2025-08-02

### Added

- Vitest testing suites for `Footer.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, and `AuthContext.jsx`

### Changed

- Removed an old firebase.js file that had no content inside of it from original scaffold
- Added a spy call to `ForgotPasswordModal.test.jsx` inside of **Test 6** to avoid the error console log from showing during testing.
- Deleted a redundant `context` folder (from `root`), including deleting an internal `AuthProvider.jsx` file. I checked through imports and files, and found no reference to it. It was likely created during initial scaffolding and then forgotten about as I created more files and made `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`

### Fixed

- Refactored files to use default export directly
- Debugged and fixed testing suite issues for `Header.jsx`
  - Realized that some of the previous issues with mocks had to do with imports not quite matching.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-08-03 - 2025-08-07

### Added

- Created a LogCleanup nav page
- Added the `log-cleanup` route to `App.jsx`
- Created a LogCleanupForm.jsx, still untested until pages are connected
- Added `LogCleanupPage` to the `Header`, making it only visible for authenticated users.
- Added a `ProtectedRoute` wrapper to `log-cleanup`'s navigation, preventing users from navigating to that page if they aren't authenticated. Redirects to `/login`
- Created `PublicOnlyRoute.jsx` file and placed it in `components/shared`. Works similar to `ProtectedRoute.jsx`.

### Changed

- Deleted submissions based scaffolded files that were from an earlier design
- Redesigned the way **log cleanup submissions** will be logged, including removing `UploadPhoto`
- Removed imports for `useRedirectIfAuthenticated` from `SignUpPage` and `LoginPage`
- Removed function calls for **useRedirectIfAuthenticated** from `SignUpPage` and `LoginPage`.
- Imported and wrapped `PublicOnlyRoute` in `App.jsx` for **/signup** and **login**
- Deleted `useRedirectIfAuthenticated` from the **components/hooks**. Ran a script beforehand to make sure I had removed all imports and references beforehand.
- Added a `PublicOnlyRoute` wrapper to the `/` **Welcome Page** route, so it will navigate an authorized user to the dashboard instead.

### Fixed

- A few typos that were causing some route and nav bugs for `log-cleanup`
- Changed **PublicOnlyRoute** function in `PublicOnlyRoute.jsx` to **PublicOnlyRoute**
- Fixed inconsistent re-route handling procedures. Standardized to a route wrapper instead of using a hook. Updated any re-routes needed to follow this logic.

## [0.2.6] - 2025-08-12

### Added

- Created the Firebase firestore database
- Created structure for **users**
- Created sturcture for **cleanupEntries**

### Changed

- Changed firestore security rules from strict to allow users to change access and change their entries in the database, but no one elses'
- Added **Firestore initalization** in my `firebase.js` file.

## [0.2.7] - 2025-08-16 - 2025-08-17

### Added

- Created a `PointsDisplay` reusable component with size props to make it reusable across a variety of display types and components.
- Added code to `LogCleanupButton` to take props for sizing to make it reusable across pages and components.
- Created a `buttonStyles` file that houses reusable styles for buttons across the app. Uses swiches for **size** (small, medium, large) and **color** (font and bg color - primary and secondary) to make it reusable across the app for different styles of buttons.
- Created `CleanupEntriesList.jsx`, an **Eco** component that shows user logged cleanup entries. Reusable so it can be truncated or show the entire list on a dedicated page.
- An index to Firebase for **cleanup entries** that allows for ordering the entries by **desc**
- Created `CleanupEntriesListPage.jsx`, to house the complete entries list from an authorized user. Added the boilerplate code that all of my pages use, including calling `ProtectedRoute`. For now, the logic to connect to the user's entries isn't there just yet. Simple page first.

### Changed

- Added functionality to `LogCleanupForm` to calculate and store user points from logged cleanup entries.
- Changed navigation for `LogCleanupForm` so that it navigates to user Dashboard after a completed entry, and resets the form when a user hits cancel.
- Added a points visual to `DashboardPage` so user can see updated totals.
- Renamed `LogTrashButton` to `LogCleanupButton`
- Refactored `LogCleanupButton` to take in the styles from `buttonStyles` and make it more reusable. Has default parameters for sizing and color (large and primary).
- Changed the `DashboardPage` to take in the `LogCleanupButton` with the changes.
- Refactored `StartQuestButton` component to take in buttonStyles. I did not make this one as reusable, as it doesn't take in default parameters for sizing and color as I think it will only be used in one place.
- Changed a few basic values in `buttonStyling` to match the original values in the original `StartQuestButton`.
- Updated `DashboardPage` to take `CleanupEntries` list. Shows the last 3 entries and a view all button that will navigate to a dedicate entries page.
- Added the route to `App.jsx` for `CleanupEntriesListPage.jsx`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the dropdowns not showing up correctly in `LogCleanupForm`
- Fixed bugs that were causing errors in submitting the `LogCleanupForm`
- Fixed the variable from the alert message in `LogCleanupForm` that is supposed to show EcoPoints. Needed to change from regular single quotes to backticks.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the city and state fields in `LogCleanupForm` to be required even though they weren't explictly set.

## [0.2.8] - 2025-08-19

### Added

- Created a `colors.js` file in styles that allows for reusable colors across the app instead of hardcoded colors. Will make design changes much easier in the future.
- Created a `jsconfig` file that will hopefully create more consistency in how **VS Code** recognizes files and imports them.

### Changed

- Incorporated `CleanupEntriesList` into `CleanupEntriesListPage` to show all entries once user navigates there.
- Updated the `src_structure.txt` file
- Updated `CleanupEntriesListPage` so it only shows the 10 most recent, and then offers a **Show All** button to view the rest.
- Added the button styling component to `CleanupEntriesList` to take on reusable button styling.
- Incorporated `colors.js` into `buttonStyles` so the buttons can draw from those colors directly instead of hardcoding.
- Added a **navButtonTextColor** into `colors.js` and used that in `LoginPage.jsx` so the nav button color is reused.
- Added a **ecoDisplayTextColor** option in colors, to be reused for Eco-text display items.
- Imported `colors` to both `CleanupEntriesList` and `PointsDisplay` and used **ecoDisplayTextColor** for the points gained and displayed.

### Fixed

- Inconsistent file recognition with **VS Code**.

## [0.2.9] - 2025-08-20

### Added

- Created a `DeleteCleanupEntryModal.jsx` file that shows a modal for all users when they click the X button for deleting a logged entry.
- Created a `useCleanupEntries` hook, which is used to fetch and update data for `CleanupEntriesList`
- Added a **isCancel prop** to `FormButton` to allow for differences in cancel button styling.
- Added delete logic to `CleanupEntriesList` to allow for deletion of logged entries.
- Added logic to `CleanupEntriesList` to take on the `DeleteCleanupEntryModal`.
- Added **deleteEntry** to the hook call in `CleanupEntriesList` and changed **onDeleteSuccess** to **onConfirm**
- Added logic so `CleanupEntriesList` navigates back to dashboard after a deleted entry is confirmed.
- Added **useLocation** to `PointsDisplay` and use **location.key** when fetching user points to properly reload the information on the page, so that `PointsDisplay` doesn't require a refesh

### Changed

- Passed the **isCancel prop** into `LogCleanupForm` to allow for styling differences in the form.
- Deleted **formButtonStyles** from `styles/forms`, as the new standard will be using `buttonStyles` for all buttons.
- Deleted most of the logic from `jsconfig` to stop **VS Code** from assuming all imports are on the same level as the file using the import
- Moved the useEffect block from `CleanupEntriesList` to `useCleanupEntries` and deleted any leftover imports and constants.
- Added user points fetching to the `useCleanupEntries` hook.
- Updated the return for `usecleanupEntries` to include the user points, and updated `CleanupEntriesList` to match.
- Removed the **handleConfirmDelete** logic in `DeleteCleanupEntryModal` and added the delete logic to `useCleanupEntries`.
- Added an **await to onConfirm** for `CleanupEntriesList`, so it will wait for that process to finish.
- Changed the **onClick** function in `CleanupEntriesList` to use **React Router** instead of **window.location.href** for consistency and efficiency.

### Fixed

- **Cancel button** now has a different color than the Confirm button.
- User points showing as **0** in the `DeleteCleanupEntryModal`.
- User points not updating when a deletion occurs, creating permanent user points discrepencies.
- A bug preventing user points from updating properly via `PointsDisplay` without a refresh

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-21

### Added

- Added an edit button to each **cleanup entry**
- Added **cleanup entry** handling and fetching logic for editing
- Added **state variables** to `CleanupEntriesList`
- Created a `UpdateCleanupEntryModal.jsx` modal that pops up when a user hits the edit button on any entry. Uses `LogCleanupForm` directly.
- Added the `UpdatecleanupEntryModal` reference to `CleanupEntries`
- Added logic to **HandleSubmit** in `LogCleanupForm` so the alert changes depending if they are creating or updating.
- Added a refresh for **onUpdate** so it properly refreshes the current page/state with user points.
- Added state management to handle edited entries and to properly refresh data on the screen.
- Created a `PointsContext.jsx` file that grabs and updates the user points in one dedicated place.
- Wrapped my **App** with **PointsProvider** from `PointsContext`

### Changed

- Modified `LogCleanupForm` to accept and handle existing entries, instead of just new ones. Includes new props for cancelling, editing, and existing entries.
- Edited the form button in `LogCleanupForm` with a tenary operator so it uses onCancel in edit mode, and handleCancel when it just wants a refresh.
- Removed the points fetch logic and so on from `PointsDisplay` and used `PointsDisplay` directly.
- Removed the fetching logic for user points from `useCleanupEntries` and used **usePoints** directly from `PointsContext` for both deleting and updating.
- Cleaned up `DashboardPage` by removing stale, unused imports and state variables.
- Deleted `EcoPointsDisplay`, since it was from my old scaffold and is redundant with `PointsDisplay`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `UpdateCleanupEntryModal` wasn't closing properly on cancel, and was instead just clearing the form.
- Fixed an issue where `PointsDisplay` was refreshing much later/required a refresh than the edited entries were refreshing.

---
