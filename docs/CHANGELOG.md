### Changed

- Updated `HomePage.jsx` with Footer integration
- Renamed `HomePage.jsx` to `WelcomePage.jsx` to clarify its role as the public splash screen

## [0.1.2] - 2025-07-04 - 2025-07-05
### Added
- Created `PageLayout.jsx` to abstract and centralize `Header`, `MainContainer`, and `Footer`
- Added new route to `App.jsx`: `/login` renders `LoginPage.jsx`
- Created functional `StartQuestButton.jsx` with navigation to `/login` via `useNavigate`
- Integrated `StartQuestButton` into `WelcomePage.jsx` for interactive flow
- Added fallback navigation from `LoginPage.jsx` back to `WelcomePage` using logo link
- Created LogoStyles const in Header.jsx and created a better visual style for the logo as a link, which involved keeping it eco green (`#28a745`) to match brand identity (For now).

### Changed
- Refactored `WelcomePage.jsx` to use reusable `PageLayout.jsx` for consistent layout scaffolding
- Updated `MainContainer.jsx` usage to follow DRY principles across pages
- Updated `Header.jsx` to link the TrashQuest logo to `/` for intuitive navigation

- Linked `LoginPage.jsx` to `/signup` via `<Link>` for new users
- Linked `SignupPage.jsx` back to `/login` for returning users
- Created `FormGroup.jsx` in `components/shared/` to abstract label/input pairs for reuse across forms

### Changed
- Refactored `SignupPage.jsx` to use `FormGroup` for display name, email, and password inputs
- Updated `<form>` styling in `SignupPage` to center all form elements (labels, inputs, and button) relative to the page
- Improved visual hierarchy and spacing for form layout and call-to-action button

### Fixed
- Fixed `App.jsx` showing up as `app.jsx` in Git.
- Fixed staging issues with `App.jsx` not importing correctly due to cache.

---
