- Updated `HomePage.jsx` with Footer integration
- Renamed `HomePage.jsx` to `WelcomePage.jsx` to clarify its role as the public splash screen

## [0.1.2] - 2025-07-04 - 2025-07-05
### Added
- Created `PageLayout.jsx` to abstract and centralize `Header`, `MainContainer`, and `Footer`
- Added new route to `App.jsx`: `/login` renders `LoginPage.jsx`
- Created functional `StartQuestButton.jsx` with navigation to `/login` via `useNavigate`
- Integrated `StartQuestButton` into `WelcomePage.jsx` for interactive flow
- Added fallback navigation from `LoginPage.jsx` back to `WelcomePage` using logo link
- Created LogoStyles const in Header.jsx and created a better visual style for the logo as a link, which involved keeping it eco green (`#28a745`) to match brand identity (For now).

### Changed
- Refactored `WelcomePage.jsx` to use reusable `PageLayout.jsx` for consistent layout scaffolding
- Updated `MainContainer.jsx` usage to follow DRY principles across pages
- Updated `Header.jsx` to link the TrashQuest logo to `/` for intuitive navigation

### Fixed

## [0.1.3] - 2025-07-07

### Added
- Created `SignupPage.jsx` with layout via reusable `PageLayout`
- Added `/signup` route to `App.jsx` for public onboarding access
- Linked `LoginPage.jsx` to `/signup` via `<Link>` for new users
- Linked `SignupPage.jsx` back to `/login` for returning users
- Created `FormGroup.jsx` in `components/shared/` to abstract label/input pairs for reuse across forms

### Changed
- Refactored `SignupPage.jsx` to use `FormGroup` for display name, email, and password inputs
- Updated `<form>` styling in `SignupPage` to center all form elements (labels, inputs, and button) relative to the page
- Improved visual hierarchy and spacing for form layout and call-to-action button

### Fixed
- Fixed `App.jsx` showing up as `app.jsx` in Git.
- Fixed staging issues with `App.jsx` not importing correctly due to cache.

## [0.1.4] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- Created `FormButton.jsx` component for reusable submit buttons with shared styling.
- Declared `formButton` styles in `forms.js` for centralized control.
- Added styled button to `SignupPage.jsx` and wired up `handleSubmit`.

### Changed
- Refactored `FormGroup.jsx` to use abstracted styles:
  - Introduced `formGroupWrapper` and `formGroupLabel` in `forms.js`.
  - Removed inline styling for wrapper and label.
- Updated `inputField` styling in `forms.js` to achieve proper centering and sizing:
  - Switched back to `width: '100%'` with `maxWidth`.
  - Added `marginLeft: 'auto'`, `marginRight: 'auto'` for centering.

### Fixed
- Resolved persistent input centering and width issues by coordinating `formContainer` and `inputField` layout logic.
- Corrected import path for `inputField` in `FormGroup.jsx` (`../../styles/forms`).
- Fixed syntax error in `forms.js` export statement that caused `ERR_ABORTED 500` crash.


---

### Planned (Upcoming)
- `DATA_MODELS.md` with Firestore schema plans
- Firebase project setup (`Auth`, `Firestore`, `Storage`)
- `src/` scaffolding with `/components`, `/pages`, etc.
- MVP feature implementation: submission form, EcoPack draw, streak logic
