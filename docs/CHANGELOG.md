## [0.1.2] - 2025-07-04 - 2025-07-05

### Added

- Created `PageLayout.jsx` to abstract and centralize `Header`, `MainContainer`, and `Footer`

- Integrated `StartQuestButton` into `WelcomePage.jsx` for interactive flow
- Added fallback navigation from `LoginPage.jsx` back to `WelcomePage` using logo link
- Created LogoStyles const in Header.jsx and created a better visual style for the logo as a link, which involved keeping it eco green (`#28a745`) to match brand identity (For now).

- Updated `MainContainer.jsx` usage to follow DRY principles across pages

- Linked `LoginPage.jsx` to `/signup` via `<Link>` for new users
- Linked `SignupPage.jsx` back to `/login` for returning users

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.1.4] - 2025-07-08

### Added

- Created `FormButton.jsx` component for reusable submit buttons with shared styling.
- Declared `formButton` styles in `forms.js` for centralized control.

- Created `formButtonStyle` in `forms.js` for reusable button styling.
- Updated `FormButton.jsx` to reference `formButtonStyle` for cleaner abstraction.
- Applied `FormButton` component to `SignupPage.jsx` and confirmed correct rendering and submit behavior.

  - Introduced `formGroupWrapper` and `formGroupLabel` in `forms.js`.
  - Removed inline styling for wrapper and label.
- Updated `inputField` styling in `forms.js` to achieve proper centering and sizing:
  - Switched back to `width: '100%'` with `maxWidth`.
  - Added `marginLeft: 'auto'`, `marginRight: 'auto'` for centering.
    Renamed style constant from `formButton` to `formButtonStyle` to avoid naming conflicts with the component.
- Updated `.editorconfig` and VS Code `settings.json` to enforce 2-space indentation globally.
- Inserted future consideration notes into `README.md`, capturing possible additions like `LEARNING.md` and `check-env.ps1`.

- Corrected import path for `inputField` in `FormGroup.jsx` (`../../styles/forms`).
- Fixed syntax error in `forms.js` export statement that caused `ERR_ABORTED 500` crash.
- Resolved React styling error by replacing invalid syntax with properly nested style object (`style={{ ... }}`).
- Clarified `FormButton` usage patterns vs. inline `<button>` calls to prevent prop misassignment.
