# TrashQuest
TrashQuest is an environmentally-focused app that encourages trash cleanup with gatcha-style mechanics. By doing this, it rewards real-world action with digital collectibles. Unlike many gatcha-style games, the "capsules" cannot be obtained through money or video game mechanics, but instead only through real-life trash cleanup.
